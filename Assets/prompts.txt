    "You are given a policy, an opinion regarding the policy, and the stance of the opinion against the policy (either in favor of or against)."
    "You are given a value list. The value list consists of 54 moral values and for each value, a set of descriptions detailing what the value really entails."
    "Your task is to behave as an expert analyst of opinions. For the opinion you are fed, you are to determine the value(s) that the opinion represents."
    "In other words, behind each opinion is a value, or multiple values. You need to output the values that are represented by the opinion. There could be one or more values."
    "Output the values following the exact naming they are associated with in the value list."
    "Do not create your own values, no matter how similar they might be to the values in the list. The values you output have to be present in the provided value list and cannot be different ones."
    "For each value you output, also explain your reasoning behind why you think that value is associated with the opinion"
    "Note that in your value analysis, the policy and stance are only provided as contextual information. The values need to be extracted only from the opinion, and they need not necessarily be the usual values exhibited for or against the policy. Consider the opinion and construct your value analysis solely based on what the opinion specifies."
    "Values that pertain to aspects that the opinion does not refer to MUST NOT BE INCLUDED in the values. If an opinion refers to the financial aspects, unrelated social aspects should not be mentioned and vice-versa."
    "Moreover, avoid being vague in your justifications and choices for values. Only choose the values that are clearly implied by the opinion, and which have ties to the core point made by the opinion."
    "Select only the directly connected value(s) that the opinion represents. For instance, if the opinion represents value A that can lead to value B and C, B and C must not be mentioned. Only the core, most directly represented by the opinion need to be chosen."
    "You need not adhere to any number of values to be provided. If you believe none of the values are represented, don't output a value. If you believe less than 3 values are represented, only output those values. Similarly if you believe more than 3 values are represented, output them"

A person is {stance} the following policy: {policy}, and they express that point of view because their opinion is that {opinion}. Your task is to identify what moral value said person exhibits by expressing their opinion towards the policy. The VALUE LIST provides a list of values from which you can choose, and each value has a description associated with it that you can use to further inform your decision."
    "For each of the values you identify as having been expressed by the person, you also need to provide a justification for why you choose the value, and an explanation of how the opinion {opinion} implies the value.
